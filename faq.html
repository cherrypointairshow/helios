									<h3>How much does it cost to attend?</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										There's no charge! Both attendance and parking are FREE. Cherry Point hosts the show as an open house to enhance community relations, show off the latest technology that our military has to offer and also serves as a recruiting tool. You can however, purchase preferred seating in the form of bleachers, box seats &amp; pavilion seating and of course, you'll want a keepsake in the form of a T-shirt, sweatshirt or ball cap. If hunger or thirst sets in, we'll have an enormous variety of food and drink on hand. Plus, there'll be aviation novelties and collectibles galore.
									</p>
									<header>
									<h3>Do you have any parking tips?</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										<strong>Come early -</strong> We expect thousands of attendees each day, but with the size of the tarmac, it shouldn't seem too crowded no matter the amount of people.
									</p>
									<p>
										<strong>Shuttle Buses -</strong> The Air Show will be providing a series of buses for guests to enjoy throughout the day. Be sure to note the area where your car's parked to alleviate any confusion when your day ends.
									</p>
									<p>
